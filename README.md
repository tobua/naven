React based CSS-in-JS styling framework.

## Development

`npm start` in the root will build the library in watch mode. To view your changes live run `npm start` in the `/demo` folder in another terminal window as well. This will open a preview in the browser. The entry file for the demo is found in `/demo/src/index.tsx`.
